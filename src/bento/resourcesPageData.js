Access it here: <a href= "https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/Home.jsp" class="resourceLink">https://cadsr.cancer.gov/onedata/Home.jsp</a>. There are over 490 pediatric CDEs used by various entities like CCDI Data Ecosystem and Pediatric Clinical Data commons. The <b>Pediatric Cancer Core Common Data Elements</b> (CDEs) were created to standardize data collection and sharing for pediatric cancer research. To explore these standards, visit the caDSR homepage and select "Pediatric Cancer Core CDEs" under the Favorites column for a custom report of key CDEs.
